Utilities for working with timelines.

> Heads up! This project is a work in progress.

## Motivation

A timeline is a visual representation of information related to video. For instance, you may want to render an element that represents
how long a video is. And maybe you want to display markers on that element to represent a user's selection within that video.

This interface would be a _timeline_. The math behind timelines can be complicated, and this library exists to help you with that math.

## Installation

This project is a work-in-progress, and isn't currently published on npm.
